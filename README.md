# 📦 Positron R Package Manager

Manage your R extensions from within [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) — the RStudio-style package manager for the modern data science IDE.

> **Maintenance notice:** Recent versions of Positron include built-in package managers for R and Python. This project is no longer maintained. Version 0.2.6 is provided as a security update to address a dependency vulnerability.

# 📚 How to Find the Sidebar

Once the extension is installed and activated, you can find the R Package Manager sidebar by looking for the 📖 icon of an opened book in the primary sidebar on the left side of the VS Code window.

This icon represents the R packages view provided by this extension.

## 🧭 Recommended: Move it to the Right (Just like RStudio)

To better match the layout you're familiar with in RStudio, you can _drag_ the entire R Package Manager sidebar to the secondary sidebar on the right.

Alternatively,

1. Right-click the opened book icon (📖) or the sidebar tab.

2. Choose "Move to" then "Secondary Side bar" from the context menu.

3. The sidebar will now appear on the right, just like the RStudio "Packages" pane.

You can always move it back or rearrange it as you prefer.

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

This extension provides the following setting:

- `positron-r-package-manager.filterOutdatedIfUpToDateElsewhere`  
  _(boolean, default: `true`)_  
  When enabled, filters out outdated R packages if an up-to-date version exists in another library during updates. This helps ruling out package installations that are not updatable in their current locations.

- `positron-r-package-manager.showIcons`
  _(boolean, default: false)_
  When enabled, displays a small R logo and a package type icon next to each package in the sidebar to visually indicate package entries.

- `positron-r-package-manager.defaultInstaller`
  _(string, default: `"native"`)_
  Choose which package installer to use:
  - `"native"`: Use R's built-in `install.packages()` function
  - `"pak"`: Use the `pak::pkg_install()` function (requires the pak package to be installed)

You can configure this setting in your VS Code settings (`settings.json`) or through the Settings UI.

## 📂 Commands

You can access these from the sidebar or Command Palette:

## 🔧 Development & CI/CD

### For Copilot Agent Development

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows specifically designed to work with GitHub Copilot's coding agent:

- **Setup Workflow** (`.github/workflows/setup.yml`): Runs before firewall restrictions are enabled to pre-download all necessary dependencies including VS Code test binaries
- **Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): Uses cached dependencies to run tests without external network access

The setup workflow resolves the common issue where `pnpm run test` fails with `ENOTFOUND update.code.visualstudio.com` by pre-downloading VS Code binaries using `@vscode/test-electron`.

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Build extension (development mode)
pnpm run compile

# Build extension (production mode)  
pnpm run package

# Package the extension as a VSIX
vsce package --no-dependencies

# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Compile tests
pnpm run compile-tests

# Run tests (requires network access to download VS Code)
pnpm run test
```

Use `--no-dependencies` because the extension bundle includes its runtime code and `vsce`'s dependency check expects an npm-style installation, which is not compatible with this pnpm setup.

### GitHub Actions Setup

The repository includes automated workflows for:
- **Publishing**: Builds and publishes to Open VSX registry and GitHub releases
- **Setup**: Pre-downloads dependencies for isolated environments
- **Testing**: Validates functionality using cached dependencies
